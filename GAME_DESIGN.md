# Clone Chaos - Game Design Document

## Core Concept
A survival puzzle game where a scientist must escape a deteriorating laboratory while managing increasingly unpredictable clones that spawn every 10 seconds and mimic the player's previous actions.

## Game Mechanics

### Clone Mimicry System
- **Spawn Frequency**: New clone spawns every 10 seconds
- **Behavior**: Clones exactly replicate the scientist's previous movement sequence
- **Degradation**: Clones become progressively more mindless over time
- **Memory Buffer**: Each clone stores a sequence of player actions from when it was "recorded"
- **Synchronization**: All clones execute their stored actions simultaneously

### Environmental Puzzles
- **Pressure Plates**: Require multiple entities (scientist + clones) to activate
- **Timed Switches**: Must be activated in sequence or simultaneously
- **Moving Platforms**: Require coordinated movement to traverse
- **Laser Barriers**: Can be blocked by positioning clones strategically
- **Resource Collection**: Items that must be gathered by different entities

### Time Pressure System
- **Laboratory Implosion**: Countdown timer creates urgency
- **Escalating Danger**: Environmental hazards increase over time
- **Clone Degradation**: Older clones become less reliable
- **Fail States**: Lab implosion or scientist death ends game

### Player Controls
- **Movement**: WASD or Arrow Keys
- **Interaction**: Spacebar for switches/items
- **Clone Management**: Visual indicators for clone positions
- **Time Awareness**: Clear countdown display

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Player Controller**: Handles input and movement
2. **Clone Manager**: Spawns and manages clone behavior
3. **Action Recorder**: Records player actions for clone playback
4. **Puzzle System**: Modular puzzle components
5. **Timer System**: Countdown and time-based events
6. **Audio/Visual Cues**: Feedback for spawning and interactions

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient clone rendering with object pooling
- Optimized pathfinding for multiple entities
- Memory management for action sequences
- Smooth performance with 10+ active clones

## Narrative Framework
The scientist has accidentally triggered a temporal anomaly in the laboratory, creating unstable clones of themselves. As the facility begins to collapse, they must use these clones strategically to solve puzzles and escape before the entire structure implodes.

## Win/Fail Conditions
- **Win**: Scientist reaches the exit before timer expires
- **Fail**: Timer reaches zero (lab implosion) or scientist is eliminated by hazards

## Development Phases
1. Core clone mimicry prototype
2. Basic puzzle mechanics
3. Time pressure and environmental systems
4. Polish, audio, and visual effects
5. Playtesting and balancing
